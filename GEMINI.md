# DocuSeal Application Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the DocuSeal application, including its core functionality, technical stack, and key features.

## Core Functionality

*   **Document Signing:** The primary purpose of DocuSeal is to facilitate the digital signing of documents. It allows users to upload PDF documents, add various form fields (signatures, dates, text, etc.), and send them to multiple recipients for signing.
*   **PDF Form Builder:** It includes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for creating and arranging form fields on a PDF document.
*   **User Management:** The application supports user accounts, allowing individuals and organizations to manage their documents and signing processes.
*   **Email Automation:** It uses SMTP to send automated emails for document invitations, notifications, and reminders.
*   **File Storage:** DocuSeal can store files on the local disk or integrate with cloud storage providers like AWS S3, Google Storage, and Azure Cloud.
*   **Security:** It provides features like PDF eSignature, signature verification, and user authentication (including two-factor authentication and SSO/SAML).
*   **Integrations:** The platform offers APIs and webhooks to integrate with other applications and services.

## Technical Stack

*   **Backend:** Ruby on Rails
*   **Frontend:** JavaScript, Vue.js, and Hotwired/Turbo for a reactive user experience. It uses Shakapacker (a successor to Webpacker) for managing JavaScript assets.
*   **Database:** The `Gemfile` indicates support for PostgreSQL and SQLite. The local setup guide recommends SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production.
*   **Background Jobs:** Sidekiq is used for processing background jobs, such as sending emails.
